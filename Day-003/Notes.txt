CONDITIONALS.
It is extremely important the spaces and tabs.
Correct alignment of a switch statement:

if condition:
	execute_action
else:
	execute_else
	

An else if statement is declared as "elif" in Python

Operator	Example		Meaning
not			not x		True if x is False
						False if x is True
						(Logically reverses the sense of x)
or			x or y		True if either x or y is True
						False otherwise
and			x and y		True if both x and y are True
						False otherwise
						
RANDOM NUMBERS:
It is a python module (pseudo random generator).

You use it like:
	import random	
	
	random_integer = random.randit(x, y)  --> You get a random number between X and Y including both.
	random_float = random.random() --> You get a random number between 0 and 0.99999999999xxx
